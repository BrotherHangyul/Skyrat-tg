## Title: Adds Surplus Rifles to the Supply Console

MODULE ID: A_surplus

### Description: Adds mosin-nagants to the Armoury tab of the supply console as a budget weapon for security. Security's been nerfed alot so this is essentially just something they can order now.


/datum/supply_pack/security/armory/mosin
    name = "Surplus Armoury Crate"
    desc = "Contains three budget Mosin-Nagants, chambered in 7.62. Perfect for cheap warfare, or when the shuttle vote is too democratic."
    cost = CARGO_CRATE_VALUE * 15
    contains = list(/obj/item/gun/ballistic/rifle/boltaction,
                    /obj/item/gun/ballistic/rifle/boltaction,
                    /obj/item/gun/ballistic/rifle/boltaction)
    crate_name = "surplus armoury crate"
